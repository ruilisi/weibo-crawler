## corpus
corpus is a language resource consisting of a large and structured set of texts (nowadays usually electronically stored and processed)
### corpus.txt
This corpus provides 200-dimension vector representations, a.k.a. embeddings, for over 8 million Chinese words and phrases, which are pre-trained on large-scale high-quality data.
These vectors, capturing semantic meanings for Chinese words and phrases, can be widely applied in many downstream Chinese processing tasks (e.g., named entity recognition and text classification) and in further research.
### data description
[download](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/nlp/zh/data/Tencent_AILab_ChineseEmbedding.tar.gz)
The pre-trained embeddings are in Tencent_AILab_ChineseEmbedding.txt.
The first line shows the total number of embeddings and their dimension size, separated by a space.
In each line below, the first column indicates a Chinese word or phrase, followed by a space and its embedding.
For each embedding, its values in different dimensions are separated by spaces.
